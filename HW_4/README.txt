Real Time Smartphone Sensor Data Processing! - This android app makes use of the motion sensor (gyro and accelerometer)
to 1) detect when the user shakes the phone via a shaking triggered counter that is activated when the shake is detected. 
The second 2) function of the android application is a "free mode" which allows the user to define a maximium value of phone shakes
and when this value is reached a sound is played usign the MediPlaer libray of Android Studio. As noted shown in the application there
is a mode switch which allows the user to select between modes. There is a stop and start butteon for when the user does not finish thier set 
goal steps. By defual the android app will init in free mode.
